<h1>What's Redstone</h1>
RedstoneMC is a fork of the popular Fabric modding api/toolchain and the Cardboard mod, which adds support for bukkit plugins. The Software currently supports Fabric 1.18.2 and 1.19.3 and Paper 1.18.2 and 1.19.3. The legacy version for 1.15.2 until 1.17.1 can be found in my RedstoneLegacy repository here.

<h3>Included Mods</h3>
* Cardboard: This mod adds bukkit/spigot/paper support to Fabric servers.
* MineTranslate: This mod translates Java Editon Fabric Mods to Bedrock Edition Add-Ons to make GeyserMC compatible with modded servers.
<h3>VERY IMPORTANT NOTES</h3>

1. The legacy version can only build with Java 8 (1.15.2 until 1.16.5) or 16 (1.17.1)! If you want to make plugins, new features or bugfixes for these old versions, use Java 8 / 16.
2. [b]ALL[/b] mods in the mod folder need the Fabric API to work correctly! Otherwise, the server will crash!
3. You need to [b]AGREE[/b] the EULA (End User Licence Agreement) to run the server!
4. The 1.19.3 server is in a very early alpha. It's [b]NOT[/b] intended for production use, but if you want to use it, please be aware that there can be bugs inside. If you find bugs, feel free to report them here in the Issues tab.
5. If you've feature requests, feel free to post them as a Pull request in the right tab!

The code will be here soon!
