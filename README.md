<h2> How to install? (not finished yet)</h2>
I'm using the 1.12.2 version for this tutorial.
1. Download RedstoneMC 1.12.2 from the releases page.<br>
2. Go to your terminal and type in the following:<br>
<p>Java -jar redstonemc-server-1.12.2.jar -Xmx1G -Xms1G</p><br>
3. Please wait until the server says a message like "Successfully started the server in (...ms)".<br>
4. Go to your WLAN router and open port 25565.<br>
5. Now try to connect with Minecraft version 1.12.2 and the ip address "localhost:25565" (without ").<br>
6. You can play now on your server!<br>

If you want to play with the 1.19.2 version, you've to type in:
<p>Java -jar redstonemc-server-1.12.2.jar -Xmx1G -Xms1G</p><br>

Have fun playing!
